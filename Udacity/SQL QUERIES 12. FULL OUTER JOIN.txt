Finding Matched and Unmatched Rows with FULL OUTER JOIN

SELECT *, COALESCE(accounts.sales_rep_id) filled_id
  FROM accounts
 FULL JOIN sales_reps ON accounts.sales_rep_id = sales_reps.id
 WHERE accounts.sales_rep_id IS NULL OR sales_reps.id IS NULL

In the following SQL Explorer, write a query that left joins the accounts table and the sales_reps tables on each sale rep's ID number and joins it using the < comparison operator on accounts.primary_poc and sales_reps.name, like so:
accounts.primary_poc < sales_reps.name

SELECT a.name accounts, a.primary_poc, s.name sales_reps
FROM accounts a 
LEFT JOIN sales_reps s
ON a.sales_rep_id = s.id AND a.primary_poc <    s.name

Perform the union in your first query (under the Appending Data via UNION header) in a common table expression and name it double_accounts. Then do a COUNT the number of times a name appears in the double_accounts table. If you do this correctly, your query results should have a count of 2 for each name.

WITH double_accounts AS (SELECT *
FROM accounts 
UNION ALL
SELECT *
FROM accounts)

SELECT name, COUNT(name) AS count_name
FROM double_accounts
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2;
