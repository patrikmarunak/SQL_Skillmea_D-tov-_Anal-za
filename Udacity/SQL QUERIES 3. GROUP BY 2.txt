For each account, determine the average amount of each type of paper they purchased across their orders. 
Your result should have four columns - one for the account name and one for the average quantity purchased for each of the paper types for each account.

SELECT a.name accounts, AVG(standard_qty) AS standard_avg, AVG(gloss_qty) AS gloss_avg, AVG(poster_qty) AS poster_avg
FROM accounts a 
JOIN orders o
ON a.id = o.account_id
GROUP BY a.name

Determine the number of times a particular channel was used in the web_events table for each sales rep. 
Your final table should have three columns - the name of the sales rep, the channel, and the number of occurrences. 

SELECT s.name sales_reps_name , w.channel web_events_channel, COUNT(*) AS UsedTimes 
FROM  sales_reps s
JOIN accounts a
ON s.id = a.sales_rep_id
JOIN web_events w 
ON a.id = w.account_id
GROUP BY s.name, w.channel
ORDER BY UsedTimes DESC 

Determine the number of times a particular channel was used in the web_events table for each region. 
Your final table should have three columns - the region name, the channel, and the number of occurrences. 
Order your table with the highest number of occurrences first.

SELECT r.name region_name , w.channel web_events_channel, COUNT(*) AS UsedTimes 
FROM region r
JOIN sales_reps s
ON r.id = s.region_id

ON s.id = a.sales_rep_id

GROUP BY r.name, w.channel

The below two queries have the same number of resulting rows (351), so we know that every account is associated with only one region. If each account was associated with more than one region, the first query should have returned more rows than the second query.

SELECT a.id as "account id", r.id as "region id", 
a.name as "account name", r.name as "region name"
FROM accounts a
JOIN sales_reps s
ON s.id = a.sales_rep_id
JOIN region r
ON r.id = s.region_id;
and

SELECT DISTINCT id, name
FROM accounts;
Have any sales reps worked on more than one account?

Actually all of the sales reps have worked on more than one account. The fewest number of accounts any sales rep works on is 3. There are 50 sales reps, and they all have more than one account. Using DISTINCT in the second query assures that all of the sales reps are accounted for in the first query.

SELECT s.id, s.name, COUNT(*) num_accounts
FROM accounts a
JOIN sales_reps s
ON s.id = a.sales_rep_id
GROUP BY s.id, s.name
ORDER BY num_accounts;

SELECT DISTINCT id, name
